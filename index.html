			<tr><td><p>In March of 2010, I found myself standing on the precipice of my future having survived a 9-month deployment to Baghdad, Iraq, and I was uncertain what I was going to do with the rest of my life. I knew only that my travel would be unidirectional: forward. In the intervening nine and a half years since that moment, I have occupied myself with learning how to knit, considering relational metaphysics, and striving to live purposefully every day.</p><p></p> </td></tr>

			<tr><td><p><h2>Knitting</h2>
			<p>I started learning to knit on December 29th, 2018 when I was visiting my mother. My sister had asked our mother to teacher her how to knit because she thought it looked like a useful skill and my mother asked if I would like to learn also. Having always thought that it looked like fun, I immediately said yes and she taught me the basics. The next day I went home and after working through a couple of basic projects, I started looking for more difficult projects on the Fiber Arts social media platform <a href="https://www.ravelry.com/">Ravelry.com</a>. Three weeks later, I had made a washcloth, a ball, two scarves, a hat, and then decided that I would tackle my first sweater. Three weeks after starting my sweater, I finished sewing in the zipper and with that, the sweater itself was finished. I continued making other things and then ventured into making shawls for close friends. Then, two months later, embarked on my most ambitious project to date, a shawl made from yarn barely heavier than thread and on the smallest knitting needles I owned. It took me a month, but I finally finished the piece, gifted it to a close friend, and had a startling realization. </p></td></tr>

			<tr><td><h2>Relational Metaphysics</h2>
			<p><img src="metaphysics.jpg" align="left" width="*" height="180" alt="Metaphysics image">  Much as a sweater or shawl is the culmination of a multitude of individual stiches knitted together into the resulting item, it is the combination of  a multitude of individual relationships that creates fabric of our world. I was first introduced to the realm of relational metaphysics by my pastor and friend, Hal McSwain, Ph.D., who had completed his dissertation under the tutelage of the foremost expert on the topic, <a href="https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9789024724574">Harold H. Oliver, Ph.D</a>. The basic premise is that all things are interconnected and that it is the relationship between two or more things that gives each its meaning. The end result of this conceptual framework is a vast network of interconnections that each hinges on the other nodes – in computer terms – to derive context and, therefore, meaning. One excellent exploration of these concepts that I was referred to is the movie <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0100151/">Mindwalk</a> starring Liv Ullmann, Sam Waterson, and John Heard - the full film can be found on <a href="https://youtu.be/E8s0He0560g">YouTube</a>. The most extravagant portion of the film takes the ideas of relational metaphysics and explores how they can be applied to understanding daily life and what one person owes to another or the larger society. Specifically, the film posits the idea that understanding ourselves as part of, and intimately connected to, the larger population allows us to see ourselves in others, our struggles in other’s struggles, our being in others’ being. Interestingly enough, there is a bantu word for this that has since been used as the name for a popular free operating system – <a href="http://www.ubuntu.thiyagaraaj.com/Home/about-ubuntu/ubuntu-philosophy-meaning">Ubuntu</a>.</p></tr>

			<tr><td><h2>Purposeful Living and Interconnectedness</h2>
			<p><img src="Atomic Habits.jpg" width="180" height="" align="right" alt="Atomic Habits book cover">Dolly Parton is credited with saying “Find out who you are and do it on purpose.” I have found that, in the time since my deployment, little can be accomplished that is not strived for purposefully.  However, purposeful action can only accomplish so much. The reason for this is explored in the book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07RFSSYBH/ref=cm_sw_em_r_mt_dp_U_ALJKDbHRA5PP2">Atomic Habits</a>, by James Clear. In the book, the author describes different ways of working towards goals that generally end with better results. One method that I found particularly interesting is the concept of “Habit Stacking.” It employs the idea that if one habit depends on another to be successful, then success in one area will make success in the other more probable. So, for example, if a person wants to lose weight, that person may be well served to also focus on budgeting more effectively because limiting the amount of money he/she has to spend on junk will reduce the amount he/she brings into the home – thereby also limiting the number of extra calories consumed. This, of course, returns to the idea of interconnectedness that I discussed earlier. Specifically, if that same conceptual framework is applied to the process of self-development and living purposefully, a person is better able to formulate a plan that channels all of his/her energies into a single, or at least fewer, direction(s) – thereby enabling those energies to be more efficient in the amount of work accomplished.</p>

			<p> The following items can all be uses strategically to boost success rates for goals in each of the other categories: 
			<ul>
				<li>Mental health</li>
				<li>Physical Health</li>
				<li>Finances</li>
				<li>Personal relationships</li>
				<li>Professional development</li>
			</ul></p>
